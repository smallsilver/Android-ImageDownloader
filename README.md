# Android-ImageDownloader

An enhanced ImageDownloader based on [This blog post](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/07/multithreading-for-performance.html)
and enhancements that make sense for my general use. The goal is to keep this as lightweight and as self contained as possible. Small file counts
are also desired.
